  - 'Havent seen the likes of you before... '
  - I'll assume since you wield no blade... you arent after my head.
  - Say, you couldnt have come far... Id recommend you take that torch with you as
    you travel. (E) These brimstone halls get so dark that they can consume your
    very soul.
  - You cant pick it up yet it seems, someone hasnt implemented that into the game...
  - I doubt this is the last you will see of me, stranger... Im well known around
    these parts, and you could catch me around any corner.
  - But watch your back out there will you... The dead wait paitiently.
